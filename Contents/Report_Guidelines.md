# Final Seminar Report Guidelines

**Course:** SMCE201 – Seminar & Technical Report Writing for Engineers

## 1. Purpose

The **Final Seminar Report** is the culmination of your seminar work. It should systematically present your chosen and approved topic, including background, literature review, methodology (if applicable), results/discussion, and conclusions. The report must demonstrate originality, proper structure, technical accuracy, and professional formatting.

## 2. Structure of the Report

Your final report must include the following sections in order:

1. **Title Page**

   * Report title (concise and meaningful).
   * Student’s name, roll number, department, course code, academic session.
   * Supervisor’s name and designation.
   * Institute name and logo.

2. **Abstract**

   * A brief (150–250 words) summary of the work, including objectives, scope, approach, and key findings.
   * Written in a single paragraph, without figures/tables/references.

3. **Acknowledgements**

   * A short section to thank your guide, faculty, peers, or others who supported your work.

4. **Table of Contents**

   * Auto-generated list of all sections and subsections with page numbers.

5. **List of Figures**

   * List of all figures with captions and page numbers.

6. **List of Tables**

   * List of all tables with captions and page numbers.

7. **Main Report (Chapters)**

   ### Chapter 1 – Introduction

   * Background and motivation.
   * Importance and relevance to civil engineering.
   * Objectives and scope.
   * Organization of the report (brief description of chapter-wise contents).

   ### Chapter 2 – Literature Review

   * Discuss relevant research and prior studies.
   * Each study should be explained clearly with author(s), year, objectives, and key findings.
   * Include a **summary table** comparing studies.
   * Ensure all references are properly cited.

   ### Chapter 3 – Methodology / Approach (if applicable)

   * Explain the approach, framework, or process adopted.
   * Use flowcharts, diagrams, or block schemes.
   * All figures/equations must be **numbered and captioned**.

   ### Chapter 4 – Results / Discussion

   * Present outcomes, insights, or findings from your study/review.
   * Use graphs, charts, or tables where relevant.
   * Interpret and critically analyze the results.

   ### Chapter 5 – Conclusions & Future Scope

   * Summarize the key contributions of your work.
   * Mention possible applications.
   * Suggest future directions or open problems for further research.

   ⚠️ **Note:** More chapters may be added if required (e.g., Case Study, Experimental Work, Comparative Analysis) and should be titled appropriately. Each chapter must include properly **numbered headings and subheadings**.

8. **References**

   * List all works cited in your report.
   * Use a consistent referencing style (IEEE/APA/ASCE – as prescribed).
   * Tools such as **Mendeley, Zotero, or EndNote** are recommended for managing references.
   * Ensure every in-text citation matches the reference list.

9. **Appendices** *(if required)*

   * Supplementary material (large datasets, detailed derivations, or extra figures/tables).

## 3. Formatting Guidelines

* **Font:** Times New Roman, 12 pt (main text), 14 pt (chapter titles), 16 pt (report title).
* **Line Spacing:** 1.5 spacing, justified alignment.
* **Margins:** 1 inch on all sides.
* **Page Numbers:**

  * Title page is **not numbered**.
  * Preliminary pages (Abstract, Acknowledgements, TOC, List of Figures/Tables) should use **Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, …)**.
  * Main report chapters must use **Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, …)** starting from Chapter 1.
* **Figures/Tables:**

  * Figures: *Figure 1.1 Title*
  * Tables: *Table 2.1 Title*
  * Equations: *(Eq. 3.1)*

## 4. Evaluation Criteria

Reports will be evaluated based on:

* **Content Quality** – Depth of literature review, clarity of objectives, critical discussion.
* **Structure & Organization** – Logical chapter flow, completeness of required sections.
* **Formatting & Presentation** – Consistency, captions, numbering, referencing style.
* **Originality** – Proper citations, plagiarism-free work.
* **Conclusions & Relevance** – Practical implications and future scope.
