# Seminar Presentation Guidelines

**Course:** SMCE201 – Seminar & Technical Report Writing for Engineers

## 1. Purpose

The **seminar presentation** is an essential part of this course. It allows each student to clearly communicate the outcomes of their **approved technical paper** to an audience. The goal is to demonstrate:

* Understanding of the chosen topic.
* Ability to critically review and organize literature.
* Skills in structuring technical content into an engaging presentation.
* Clarity, professionalism, and confidence in delivery.

## 2. General Structure of the Presentation

Your seminar presentation should follow a **logical, professional flow**:

1. **Title Slide**

   * Topic title, student name, roll number, course code.

2. **Introduction & Motivation**

   * Background of the problem.
   * Importance & relevance of the topic to civil engineering.

3. **Objectives & Scope**

   * Clearly define objectives.
   * State scope and limitations of your seminar.

4. **Literature Review**

   * Discuss **each major study** on **separate slides**, if possible.
   * Use concise bullet points.
   * Preferably prepare a **summary table** to compare works.

   **Sample Table Format:**

   | Title of Study | Authors | Journal/Conference (Year) | Objectives | Key Findings / Recommendations | Limitations / Conclusions |
   | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
   | | | | | | |

6. **Methodology / Approach** *(if applicable)*

   * Flowcharts, block diagrams, or process steps.
   * Ensure **all diagrams/flowcharts/equations are properly numbered and captioned**.

7. **Results / Discussion**

   * Highlight key results, findings, or insights from your review.
   * Use graphs, figures, or charts (must be **captioned and cited**).

8. **Conclusions & Future Scope**

   * Summarize key points.
   * Provide recommendations or potential future research directions.

9. **References**

   * Include all works cited in your slides.
   * Use consistent style (same as in your technical paper).
   * Tools such as **Mendeley, Zotero, or EndNote** are recommended for managing **citations (text + images/figures)**.
   * All figures/tables from literature must include proper attribution in captions.

## 3. Formatting Guidelines

* **Font Type:** Use a uniform professional font (e.g., Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman).
* **Font Size:** Minimum 24 pt for slide text, 32 pt for headings.
* **Slide Count:** 15–20 slides (for 12–15 minutes presentation).
* **Visuals:** Prefer diagrams, flowcharts, and figures instead of long text.
* **Captions & Numbering:**

  * Figures: *Figure 1: Example Caption*
  * Tables: *Table 1: Example Caption*
  * Equations: *(Eq. 1)*
* **Consistency:** Keep alignment, bullet style, and color scheme consistent across all slides.

## 4. Presentation & Delivery Tips

* Practice multiple times to stay within time (12–15 minutes).
* Speak clearly, confidently, and maintain eye contact.
* Avoid reading directly from slides—summarize and explain.
* Use a **pointer/laser/animations** only when necessary.
* Prepare to answer questions from faculty and peers.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

Your presentation will be assessed based on:

* **Content Quality** – Depth, relevance, and logical flow.
* **Literature Review** – Coverage, clarity, and use of table/figures.
* **Formatting & Professionalism** – Fonts, numbering, consistency.
* **Delivery Skills** – Clarity, confidence, time management.
* **Originality** – Proper citations, no plagiarism.
