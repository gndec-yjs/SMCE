## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Golden Rules for Topic Selection  

| ‚úÖ Do's | ‚ùå Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Choose something **you are genuinely curious about** | Pick a topic just because it ‚Äúsounds cool‚Äù |
| Ensure **availability of research material** | Choose a topic with no accessible data or papers |
| Pick a **specific and focused** area | Select something too broad like ‚ÄúCivil Engineering‚Äù |
| Check **relevance to current trends** | Go for outdated technology unless for historical comparison |
| Align with your **career/research goals** | Select random topics unrelated to your interests |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Topic Suitability Checklist  

- [ ] Is it related to **Civil Engineering**?  
- [ ] Is it **recent** (last 5‚Äì7 years of research)?  
- [ ] Can I find at least **5 credible sources**?  
- [ ] Is the **scope manageable** for a seminar (not a PhD thesis)?  
- [ ] Am I **personally interested** in exploring it?
